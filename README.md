<h1 align="left"> Deep learning approaches for depth-map prediction in fringe projection profilometry. </h1>

### This is the main repository of the DL4CV course project *developed by Fernando Quintero*.

In this project we propose the implementation of a digital twin to simulate the reconstruction of 3D objects with the digital fringe projection technique. The main utility of this system is the flexibility to acquire the fringe images, obtaining a large number of images (faithful and with the same parameters of the real system) in a short time taking advantage of the GPU of the computer and thus being able to create feasible Datasets for the training of Deep Learning models.
